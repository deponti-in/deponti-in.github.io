prose.io provides a very easy to use, minimal, yet intuitive interface, allowing even people without git know-how, to easily wade through their site files and make edits, or create new posts. The separate metadata entry mechanism is nice, and the preview functionality gives one an opportunity to inspect stuff, before committing their changes/posts.
The metadata for this post looks like this
