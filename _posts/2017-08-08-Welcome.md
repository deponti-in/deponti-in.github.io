This blog template is derived from Barry Clark's Jekyll-Now template.
In order to set it up afresh, you can follow the excellent documentation, and also see the demo of the Jekyll-Now site [here](http://www.jekyllnow.com/). The same site also has a Markdown style guide, for reference.

Barry's code was an excellent starting point, and it was almost everything I needed. The only things I felt like adding on top of this was a tag cloud.
In order to use tags, specify 'tags' in the front-matter of the post.

Now, in order to activate the tag(s), you'll have to create tag page(s). 
For example, to activate a tag called 'jekyll', in the tag directory, simply copy template.md to jekyll.md, and within jekyll.md, change the value of the title variable, from 'template' to 'jekyll'.

>Tip: precreate a bunch of tags that you feel you would use. When you write posts which use these tags later, the tags will be active right away.
 
The other addition is pagination, which I felt was a nice thing to have, to limit displayed posts to a preset number (current default is 5). To change this value, you can edit the value assigned to the 'paginate' variable in the _config.yml file.
